    <h2 style="color:crimson; font-size:20px;"> INFORMATION ABOUT BAJI PRABHU</h2>
  </body>
    <p>
        Bajiprabhu Deshpande was born into the CKP caste (Chandrasainya Kayastha Prabhu) caste of scribes. But from a young age Bajiprabhu Deshpande had a martial spirit in him. In those days India was suffering from the tyranny of the Mughals . Bajiprabhu Deshpande wanted to serve his country and help liberate it from the Mughal yoke. The rise of Shivaji Maharaj gave Bajiprabhu Deshpande the opportunity he was seeking.

    <p>
        Shivaji Maharaj, seeing the intense love for the motherland in Bajiprabhu Deshpande gave him military command of south Maharashtra around the Kolhapur region.  Bajiprabhu Deshpande played an important role when the fearsome General Afzal Khan was sent by the Adilshahi king to slay Shivaji Maharaj and destroy the fledgling Maratha Kingdom. Bajiprabhu Deshpande brought with him a few select band of Maratha warriors who included Visaji Murambak who was as tall and heavily built as Afzal Khan. Shivaji Maharaj practiced the duel with Afzal Khan using Visaji as his sparring partner.

        The post-Afzal-Khan slaying, Shivaji Maharaj and his men created havoc (“NAAK-MEIN-DUM“) on Adilshah’s powerful forces and harried and tormented them relentlessly with their ferocious guerilla tactics.  Unleashing fierce counter-terrorism backed by good intelligence, the Marathas were a succor to all those suffering Hindu innocents on whom Adilshah’s jihadi army rained callous terror without respite like a never-ending nightmare.  And it was during these days that Shivaji Maharaj and his men had based themselves at the Panhala fort.  The Jehadi army of Adilshah came to know of this and immediately laid siege to the fort under the able command of general Siddi Johar.  The siege lasted for many months and Siddi Johar was getting increasingly successful in cutting off  vital supplies to the Panhala fort and thereby forcing Shivaji Maharaj’s hand.  He had to get out of there and he had to get out soon.

    <p>
        All attempts to raise the siege were foiled. Even Shivaji Maharaj’s senapati (Commander) Netaji Palkar could not break through the siege from outside. Hence Shivaji Maharaj decided to give a final battle. But instead of suicidal attack, he followed a different strategy. A grand escape was planned to give a battle from the fort Vishalgad.

    <p>
        Firstly, Shivaji Maharaj sent his vakil (lawyer)l to Siddi Jauhar saying that he was ready to sign a treaty with him. Siddi Jauhar and his army thus relaxed a bit, foreseeing that their siege going on for months together was going to end. Still, getting through the siege of about 10000 Adilshahi soldiers seemed impossible.

    <p>
        According to the plan on a stormy full moon’s night (night of Guru Pournima, Ashadh Vadya Paurnima) a band of 600 select men set out, led by Baji Prabhu and Shivaji Maharaj. They split up into two groups.  One was a decoy that was led by a man called Shiva Navi, who resembled Shivaji Maharaj very closely and the other led by Shivaji Maharaj and this group also consisted the valiant Baji and other brave Marathas.  Shiva Nhavi’s group served as the perfect bait as Siddi Johar’s alert troops who had gotten wind of the escape plan through their network of informers.  The Jehadis captured Shiva Navi to their undiminished glee but were terribly enraged when they discovered the subterfuge that it was fake Shivaji (Nakli-Shivaji). They promptly beheaded Shiva Nhavi (This valiant sacrifice by Shiva Nhavi for his master brought some much needed valuable time for the escaping Maratha warriors) and the Mugals immediately set in hot pursuit of the real shivaji (Asli-Shivaji).
